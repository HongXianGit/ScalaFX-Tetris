# Scalafx-Tetris
Tetris using Scalafx. It was my project for PRG2104 Object Oriented Programming during my second year.

It allows the player to play the Tetris game, record the score, view the leaderboard and instructions, and navigate the program using a mouse or keyboard. Tetris game is a tile-matching game that let the players gain points by filling up the lines. The game ends when the block is over the game area. When it is game over, the score of each player will be stored inside the database.

The controls are left-right-up-down and spacebar. Full horizontal lines will disappear and provide points after they have been filled with shaped blocks.
